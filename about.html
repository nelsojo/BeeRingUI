        </div>
        <h3 class="outlined-text">A collaborative effort for the Senior Capstone Project, The Bee-Ring UI demonstrates that simple technology
        that automates data collection can be a valuable tool in maintaining healthy
        bee hives</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Bee-Ring mobile app allows you to access all of your hive data from anywhere.
        Current versions allow you to receive alerts and notifications, and help you track 
        the health of your colonies. Future iterations may provide data-driven analytic
        decisions about your beekeeping operation</p>
