Problem Description

Current beekeeping methods are lacking in technological innovation. Because of climate change, parasites, pesticides, and starvation, 48 percent of honeybee colonies in America were lost in the past year, the second highest death toll on record (Borenstein, 2023).

Beekeepers are struggling to prevent a parasitic mite called Varroa from infesting these hives, and they don't have easy access to hive data in order to identify an early
infestation. With climate change, unnatural warm spots in the winter have brought bees out of hibernation early, which means beekeepers need to constantly track and manage hive temperature and humidity, usually with a manual probe. If bees leave hibernation early, they will starve to death from a lack of pollen from flowering plants. We rely on bees to provide for 80 percent of pollination for insect-pollinated plants, so a loss of pollination would devastate the agricultural industry (Randall, 2022). Beekeepers need easier and

more efficient technology to address the losses beekeepers are facing in these trying times.

Scope

The scope for this product will be limited to UI development, as an automation and robotics company is working on the backend and robotics functionality. We are currently at the
prototyping phase with the Bee-Ring, so the UI should be focused on delivering basic app functionality and data for the frontend. This means storing and providing the data in an easy and accessible manner, and designing an intuitive UI interface. The goal is to manage real-time hive data in order to catch any health problems early on. This helps beekeepers keep their bees healthy, without dealing directly with a mountain of data. Additionally, there is a difference between hobby beekeeping and industrial beekeeping, with industrial beekeeping being at a much larger scale. With this in mind, this project is focusing exclusively on hobby beekeeping for now, but for future iterations, our project partner wants to include versions for industrial beekeeping and beekeeping research.

Use Cases

Early Disease Detection
A beekeeper receives a notification on their smartphone when the monitoring system detects unusual temperature changes in a hive. This allows the beekeeper to investigate and address potential health issues, possibly preventing the spread of diseases within the colony.

Optimal Hive Environment
 A beekeeper uses the system to maintain the right environmental conditions in the hives, especially during bad weather conditions. The monitoring system automatically adjusts temperature and humidity levels, ensuring the health of the colony. This stability leads to increased pollination rates and better honey production.

Remote Hive Monitoring and Management
 Beekeepers, with hives in various locations, remotely monitor all their hives through a centralized dashboard. This enables prompt issue identification and potential resolution from a distance, ensuring the health of bee colonies without the need for frequent on-site visits.
 The user will check their beehive statistics through the app and see trends over a certain period of time such as changes in temperature or humidity.
 The user checks the health of their hive while they are at work. They see that the humidity of the hive is lower than optimal. They make an adjustment on the app to raise the humidity of the hive.

Efficient Hive Inspections
 Beekeepers can remotely access hive data to make informed decisions about hive management. For example, they schedule inspections only when the system detects problems, reducing disruptions to the bees, saving time, and optimizing how resources are used.
 The user will be able to check on the queen bee status to see whether she is missing or present.
 The user will be able to see whether they need to refill the feeding trays.

Bee Ring Device Management
 The user will access their settings on the app and select which specific notifications they want on beehive activity.
 The user will access their settings on the app and select the thresholds for certain notifications (i.e. temperature min and max, humidity min and max, etc).
 The user will add beehives with a Bee-Ring to the app so they can view the statuses for multiple bee hives via bluetooth connection.
 The user will set and track hive management goals through the Hive Management tab.

Purpose and Vision (Background)
Our purpose is to develop a beekeeping app that provides users with data on the health and productivity of their hives in real time so that users can improve beehive conditions and monitor changes over time.
We want beekeepers to use our product for current and future hives; as more users interact with this product, more bees are saved.
Currently, beekeepers are struggling with excessive hive losses every year, due to climate change, parasites, pesticides, and starvation. With the right data, some of these problems can be prevented with early detection of abnormalities in the hive. As it stands, beekeepers don't have easy access to preventative technologies.
The Bee Ring wants to make beekeeping easy and effective, especially for small-scale beekeepers facing challenges due to declining bee populations. We want to simplify hive management by using smart technology. Our vision is to empower beekeepers with a user-friendly tool that manages hive data and prevents health issues early on. The Bee Ring is designed for beekeepers who are passionate about their hives but struggle with the
complexities of hive management. Our vision is to empower beekeepers with a tool that takes care of the details, so they can enjoy beekeeping without the stress.
While our focus is on making beekeeping easier for small-scale beekeepers, this project intends to lay the groundwork for future expansion, envisioning the evolution of the Bee-Ring into a comprehensive solution tailored for large-scale commercial beekeeping. We intend to support the diverse needs of all beekeepers, from hobbyists to industry professionals, and make the Bee-Ring a valuable tool in beekeeping of all scales.
