         <h3>Welcome to the Bee-Ring Project site! Our Senior Capstone Project Portal. </h3>
        <br>
         <p>This platform is dedicated to providing insights and technological solutions to 
            beekeepers facing the challenges of climate change. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We rely on bees to provide for 80 percent of pollination for insect-pollinated plants,
                so a loss of pollination would devastate the agricultural industry. Beekeepers need 
                easier and more efficient technology to address the losses beekeepers are facing in 
                these trying times.</p>
                <br>
        <h2>The Bee-Ring Offers Peace of Mind and Convenience to Beekeepers</h2>
        <p>The Bee-Ring device, placed inside a  beehive along with our prototype app, brings crucial hive data to beekeepers with ease.</p>

        <h2>Beekeeping Insights at the Touch of a Button</h2>
        <p>Access critical hive data immediately through our dashboard designed for simplicity, clarity, and intuitive data visualization.</p>

        <p>Our app shows historical trends from the beehive’s readings in an easy to read graph.
            and displays alerts for when the bee hive’s temperature or humidity gets too high or too low. And you can do
            it all from a secure account that stores personal hive data. </p>

        <p>A UI framework, prepared for later iterations, is also setup to switch between multiple hives, access settings, 
            and search through help pages. </p>
